node -v
npm -v
```

2. Clone the repository: (using SSH) (Chatgpt this part to know more)
```
git clone git@github.com:yourGithubUsername/HonestlyApp.git
```

3. Change directory to the root folder:
```
cd HonestlyApp
```
4. Open the folder in VS Code by using the following steps: (IMPORTANT: After you change the directory)
```

```
5. Run the server:
To run the server you need to run the following command:
```
npm start 
```

6. Check in on your local browser port 3000 to find the page that has been loaded. (signin  signup page)
It gets loaded from the public folder in the repository called index.html
